# Game of Life

This is a Golang implementation of [conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

This is my first real Golang program, I chose conway's game of life as a method of learning/getting familar with golang.

The [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) game library, a simple 2D game library was used for the visualisation componenet of the project, somewhat similar to [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for those coming from a python background.

To me, the most beautiful thing about conway's game of life is how global complex patterns can emerge from such simple local rules often termed [Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)
